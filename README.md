Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)
CS 4641 - Machine Learning

Source code and README was based on [this project](https://github.com/iRapha/CS4641/tree/master/P4). The code was edited to print runtimes for Q-learning (animate turned off) in the console and to automatically add a penalty of 50 for hitting the wall (had trouble adding this via create maze).

A description of the MDPs used can be found in the analysis pdf
This project used CMU's Reinforcement Learning Simulator.
The original source can be found here:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/
The fork I used (which has helpful image-saving features) can be found here:
https://github.com/theJenix/rl_sim_fork

The compiled RLSim jar is included in my submission, along with the source.

To run RLSim, run the MainUI file in the rl_sim_fork folder.`

The problem mazes used were:
* smallOffice.maze
* largeOffice.maze
